-- SatInfo DataBase
-- This is a database supporting the GSI runtime "satinfo" table.
-- There are three tables in this database:

1. "satops.tbl", listing satellite operations in given time periods

2. "active_channels.tbl", listing active sensors as well as channels for
  given satellites and operation periods.

3. "satinst.tbl", listing sensors and channels of all time on all
  satellites.

-- Note:

o sort.mk contains simple make() targets for maintenance purposes.

o Tables in this database are used by mksi.x as "green" lists, not
  "black" lists.

o There is no algorithm implemented to verify the data uniqueness for
  any given period.

o Invalid date-time tags are allowed, as long as they are given as valid
  integers.

o Pairs of data-time tags are used in mksi to mark "closed" domain
  boundaries.  That is, "==" are used in the relational expressions.
  For example, "time t is within a given period t1 to t2", is expressed
  as "t1<=t.and.t<=t2", which is equivalent to "t{-[t1,t2]".

o "A given time t" in current algorihm is specified in form a single
  pair of "<yyyymmdd> <hhmmss>", to represent a single moment of
  synoptic time.  This may not be sufficient if this database is used
  to provide information for an extended time period, such as 12 or 24
  hours.  For applications of extended time periods, an extention to the
  *_select() of each module is required.
